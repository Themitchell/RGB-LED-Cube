# 8x8x8 RGB LED Cube

This is my modified code for an 8x8x8 Full RGB LED cube running on an Arduino MEGA2560. 

Original code written by Kevin Darrah

The code runs on top of Norman Skinners PCB designs for SuperTech IT.

I have added some additional work around generating character displays and showing text, and formatted the code. For futrue i would like to optimize the code more if possible and try to make my code fit onto an Arduino Uno. Currently this version will not fit.
